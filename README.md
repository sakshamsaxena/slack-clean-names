# Clean Names on Slack

## Why ?

My current organisation uses Slack for collaboration. As expected, a normal employee is bound by whatever the admin decides is best for us all, which apparently includes freezing our Display Names as __firstname.lastname__ and allowing us to set our Full Name to whatever we like (weird ?). To make things worse, an absence of Full Name renders the Display Name as default for it.

I absolutely loath seeing my colleagues names in this format of __firstname.lastname__ which i think is worse than made up Display Names like `anusthrasher69`. Alphanumeric names are better than any kind of names.

## What ?

This extension would continually update any channel name or person name from __firstname.lastname__ to __Firstname Lastname__ (Capital Case) so that they look more legible.

## But really ?

Yes. Desperate times, desperate measures.
